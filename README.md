Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you can not use additional data structures?
Write code to reverse a C-Style String. (C-String means that “abcd” is represented as five characters, including the null character.)
Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer. NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine. An extra copy of the array is not.
Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not.
Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with ‘%20’.
Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, rotate by 90 deg
Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column is set to 0.
Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1

discuss stack,queue linkedlist relationship
Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.
How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, also has a function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in O(1) time.
Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.
Implement a MyQueue class which implements a queue using two stacks.
Write a program to sort a stack in ascending order. You should not make any assumptions about how the stack is implemented. The following are the only functions that should be used to write this program: push | pop | peek | isEmpty.

Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?
Implement an algorithm to find the nth to last element of a singly linked list.
Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a single linked list, given only access to that node.
You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1’s digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.EXAMPLEInput: (3 -> 1 -> 5) + (5 -> 9 -> 2)Output: 8 -> 0 -> 8
Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning of the loop.
