1 Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you can not use additional data structures?<br/>
2 Write code to reverse a C-Style String. (C-String means that “abcd” is represented as five characters, including the null character.)
3 Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer. NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine. An extra copy of the array is not.
4 Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not.
5 Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with ‘%20’.
6 Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, rotate by 90 deg
7 Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column is set to 0.
8 Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2,      write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1

108 discuss stack,queue linkedlist relationship
109 Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.
110 How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, also has a function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in O(1) time.
111 Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.
112 Implement a MyQueue class which implements a queue using two stacks.
113 Write a program to sort a stack in ascending order. You should not make any assumptions about how the stack is implemented. The following are the only functions that should be used to write this program: push | pop | peek | isEmpty.

118 Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
119 How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?
120 Implement an algorithm to find the nth to last element of a singly linked list.
121 Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a single linked list, given only access to that node.
122 You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1’s digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.EXAMPLEInput: (3 -> 1 -> 5) + (5 -> 9 -> 2)Output: 8 -> 0 -> 8
123 Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning of the loop.
